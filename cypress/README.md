# Cypress-ProductStore

Hi, I am Nicolas and I am currently working as QC Analyst. However, I would like to start working as a TAE, I started automating web pages with python and selenium but now I am coding in cypress as I like JS and by doing this I am getting more experience in a different programming language. Soon I will be doing more automation using Java, so when the time comes, i will be able to perform UI automation on the framework/language prefered by the client.

This automation is perform on a sample web page to show some of the knowledge I could implement on a real proyect.
